The Boulder Zoo's animals are now in grave danger. After countless years, the Zooâ€™s owner has decided to sell out and make money off the exotic animals in captivity. Unfortunately for the animals, the zoo is being sold to a business known as Zoo'd Food, a company that turns exotic animals into delicacies for the rich and powerful. Twelve hours before the truck will arrive and transport the animals to a certain death, Poncho the Flamingo overhears two guards discussing the fate of the animals. Poncho knows it is up to him to formulate a plan to get all of the animals to freedom. He must free the animals one by one, using each animal's unique skills to help free the other animals.
