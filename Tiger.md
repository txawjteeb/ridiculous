> A wise and powerful animal, Abella spends most of her time riddling and making complex plans to escape to freedom.  She is a predator by nature, but is glad to help the other animals to escape so long as she can get out as well.  As the only major predator in the zoo, she is distrusted by most of the animals, but she is also respected for her immense intelligence and stealthy nature.
