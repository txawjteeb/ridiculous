 The oldest animal in the zoo, Marvin is constantly complaining about his bad back.  He also complains about his bad neck.  In fact, he complains about just about everything.  He wants to see the outside of the zoo before he dies, however, so even though he has a habit of trying to weasel his way out of doing anything, he will still gladly help the other animals.
