> The oldest animal in the zoo, Marvin is constantly complaining about his bad back.  He also complains about his bad neck.  As a matter of fact, he complains about everything.  He wants to see the outside of the zoo before he dies, however, so even though he has a habit of trying to weasel his way out of doing anything, he will still gladly help the other animals.
