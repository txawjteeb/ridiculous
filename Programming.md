**Maximov, Vitaly**- Well I definitely want to learn new stuff.  I don't want to be grinding with what I already know.  I hope we will have something to showboat by the end of the project, even if it’s just simple environment interaction, like walking up to a cage and causing it to open, any kind of reaction/feedback,  something beyond a flight simulator but simple enough to not melt our brains.  I also want to see what’s happening with the engine.
