**Swift, Cynthia**- I'd really like to get a handle on 3DS Max before the end of the project (and I assume you guys want me to, as well, since I am on the World's team). I'd also like to be able to say I was a part of a project this big, especially if it is a success - I want something to show not only my family and friends, but also potential employers.  Even if we don't complete the entire game by May, I still hope to have accomplished a lot by then.

**Whitbey, Alex**- I would like to be able to design above-average models by the end of this project. If by the end of the project I can design models that actually look like they could be marketed, Iâ€™d be happy.

**Mann, Kim**- My goals are to get a better understanding of 3ds Max and to learn
more in general about 3D. I also want a project that I could put in a portfolio when I apply for college.

**Corcoran, Kyle**-For this project I would like to become an expert in Max and take over the world. If this doesn't happen I will be satisfied with completing this game and making it successful. I would be happy knowing that a game I helped create is being put to good use at CART in the future.
