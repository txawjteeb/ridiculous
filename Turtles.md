> The Turtles are an old and grumpy group, they donâ€™t like being disturbed.  It is not uncommon for the turtles to sit around and complain about the younger animals and how they are too unruly. They spend most of their time lying perfectly motionless underwater. This extends into their personality; they never really like to have to move or do anything. Overall,these turtles tend to act coldly towards others, however, they are really caring and willing to act for an important cause.
