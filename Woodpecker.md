> The woodpeckers are an incredibly strange group in that they have nearly been driven insane from constantly jarring their brains by pecking at the trees located in their habitat.  They tend to have a habit of talking at insane speeds, mainly because they live by the credo that everything they do needs to be as fast as possible.  Eccentric as they may be, however, they still view themselves as friends to the other animals, and will gladly save them before escaping themselves if they can.
