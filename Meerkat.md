> By far the smallest of the animals, Daisy is very shy and nervous around the others.  Her tiny size and the knowledge that sheâ€™s defenseless compared to the others makes her sometimes stutter and always look around shiftily.  She knows that the other animals need her help, however, and she views helping them escape as a way to prove that she is valuable to the other animals of the zoo.
