**Williams, Ryan**- Hi! I’m Ryan Williams. I would like to pwn in 3ds Max and make a great game in project ridiculous. I want to get a good grade in the class and put Game Design on the map.

**Plasencia, Jacob**- My goals are to learn more about the programs like Max and flash.My expertise in these programs may very well dictate what I do later in life, since if I learn more about these two, I may consider going into the gaming industry. Another goal to learn everyone’s name before we all go our separate ways.

**Bates, Ryan**- I wish to become proficient with the max program as well as create a fun game. Since this is a new class, our actions will dictate what future classes will learn, and I want to set a standard for the other game design classes to follow ours. In addition, I want to become familiar with animation and programming. Most importantly, however, I want to have a fun and successful year.

**Burt, Robert**- I want to see what goes into making a game and to learn how to use 3D programs like MAX more proficiently.

**Yarbrough, Shane**- I’d like to get used to using 3ds and become good with it, as well as better my modeling skills if possible. I’d also like this project to come out as well as possible and to look good as well, I look forward to the finished game.
